Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis (Excel Project)

This project presents an Excel-based data analysis of hotel booking cancellations. The goal was to uncover patterns and factors that contribute to reservation cancellations using **Pivot Tables**, **Pivot Charts**, and **basic Excel analytics tools** — without using any programming or database tools.

 Project Overview

- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel  
- **Data Source**: Hotel booking dataset (CSV)  
- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Pivot Tables  
  - Pivot Charts (Bar, Pie, Line)  
  - Data Cleaning & Formatting  
  - Filtering & Sorting  
  - Basic Statistical Analysis (Averages, Counts, Percentages)

 Objectives

- Identify the cancellation trends for **City Hotels vs Resort Hotels**
- Analyze how **customer demographics** (adults, children, babies) affect cancellations
- Examine the influence of:
  - Market Segment  
  - Stay Duration (week nights vs weekend nights)  
  - Deposit Types  
  - Lead Time  
- Visualize insights using **interactive charts**



 Key Findings

- City Hotels had a higher cancellation rate compared to Resort Hotels.
- Longer lead times were positively correlated with cancellations.
- No deposit bookings were more likely to be canceled.
- Market segments like **Online TA** had the highest share of cancellations.
- Solo travelers and those with shorter stays were more prone to cancel.

 Visuals

The Excel file contains:
- Pivot tables summarizing cancellations by hotel type, market segment, and customer type
- Pie charts for proportion of cancellations
- Bar and column charts showing booking trends
- Slicers and filters for interactivity


 Files Included

- `Hotel_Booking_Cancellation.xlsx` – Main Excel file with analysis
- (Optional) `README.md` – Project documentation

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Excel alone can be used for **data exploration, visualization, and basic analytics**, especially for those who are new to data analysis or do not use Python or SQL.
